Frequently Asked Questions

# Why is it called Tapirs? What does it stand for?
Its not an acronym, or even a retronym, we just called it Tapirs because an easy name helps everyone, and tapirs are cool.

# Why did you make this and not use X
Nothing met our needs, see the [background](background.md) page for discussion.

# Can you add in my favourite software for me?
No, sorry. We really hope however that choosing a workflow manager (Snakemake) means that this is much easier than for any other metabarcoding package. Look at the [extending Tapirs How-To guide](../How-To-Guide/extending.md).

# I've added some tools, do you want my changes?
Yes please. Do this via a pull request on github.

# Who do I contact about the software?
The best way is to flag this on GitHub. If you need to get in touch personally then contact Dave Lunt on Gmail.

# Is it licensed?
No, all parts that we have written are free under CC0 public domain and you may do as you wish. Yes, you may include whatever you wish into your own software. All components that we have included (rather than written) have permissive open source licences, but you may wish to check for yourself.

# Is there a citation
We greatly appreciate you citing us wherever you are able. A suitable citation might be:
```
Title: Tapirs, a workflow for reproducible metabarcoding
